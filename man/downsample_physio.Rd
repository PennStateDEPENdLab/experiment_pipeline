\arguments{
\item{ep.physio}{An ep.physio object created by read_acq}

\item{downsample_factor}{An integer factor used to subsample data}

\item{digital_channels}{Column names or positions containing digital channels, These will be downsampled using the
\code{downsample_digital_timeseries} function to use the within-chunk mode, rather than blind subsampling.}

\item{method}{How to downsample the signal. The default is \code{"subsample"}, which
simply takes every nth sample from the original time series. The alternative is \code{"decimate"}, which calls \code{signal::decimate}.
This applies a low-pass filter before downsampling to avoid aliasing. At the moment, there are big ringing artifacts at the beginning...}
